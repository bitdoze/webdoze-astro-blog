- **Rapid Prototyping:** Streamlit's dynamic updates let you see the impact of your code changes almost instantly, speeding up experimentation.

NiceGUI, while approachable, does demand a slightly stronger foundation in traditional GUI principles:

- **Event-Driven Model:** You'll need to understand how events (like button clicks) trigger updates in the GUI.

- **UI Definition:** Building a NiceGUI layout involves more explicit programming structures for arranging elements.

### Streamlit Code Example:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title('My First Streamlit App')
number = st.slider('Select a number', 0, 100)
st.write('You selected:', number)
```

### NiceGUI Code Example:

```python
import nicegui as ui

ui.label('My First NiceGUI App')
number = ui.slider(0, 100)
ui.label('You selected: {}'.format(number.value))

ui.run()
```

**In Summary,** Streamlit boasts a gentler learning curve for those new to GUI development. However, NiceGUI is still readily accessible, especially if you have some basic Python experience.
