Server monitoring is the systematic process of observing, tracking, and analyzing server performance metrics in real-time. It's crucial for maintaining system reliability and preventing potential issues before they impact services. Modern server monitoring encompasses various aspects:

Key Components of Server Monitoring:
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application performance
- Service availability
- Security metrics
- Container health and performance

Server monitoring has evolved significantly with the rise of containerization and microservices architectures. Today's monitoring solutions need to handle:
- Traditional bare metal servers
- Virtual machines
- Container environments
- Cloud infrastructure
- Hybrid setups

## Key Areas in Server Monitoring

Effective server monitoring focuses on several critical areas that directly impact system performance and reliability:

1. **System Resources**
   - CPU usage and load averages
   - Memory utilization and swap usage
   - Disk I/O and storage capacity
   - Network throughput and latency

2. **Application Performance**
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Request queues
   - Database performance

3. **Container Metrics**
   - Container resource usage
   - Image versions
   - Container health status
   - Network connectivity

4. **Security Monitoring**
   - Failed login attempts
   - Unusual network activity
   - File system changes
   - Security updates status

Here's a comparison of monitoring priorities based on environment:

| Metric Type | Traditional Server | Container Environment | Cloud Infrastructure |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| CPU         | Overall usage     | Per container usage  | Instance utilization|
| Memory      | Physical/Swap     | Container limits     | Instance limits     |
| Storage     | Partition usage   | Volume usage        | Block storage       |
| Network     | Interface stats   | Container networks  | VPC metrics         |

## Importance of Getting Notified in Case Something Goes Wrong

Proactive notification systems are essential for maintaining system reliability. A well-configured alerting system should:

1. **Provide Early Warning**
   - Detect potential issues before they become critical
   - Monitor trend changes that might indicate future problems
   - Alert on unusual patterns or anomalies

2. **Enable Quick Response**
   - Deliver notifications through multiple channels (email, SMS, Slack)
   - Include relevant diagnostic information
   - Provide clear action items

3. **Prevent Alert Fatigue**
   - Use intelligent thresholds
   - Implement alert correlation
   - Configure proper alert priorities

  beszel:
    image: 'henrygd/beszel'
    container_name: 'beszel'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '8090:8090'
    volumes:
      - ./beszel_data:/beszel_data
```

2. **Agent Setup:**
On each monitored server, create another `docker-compose.yml`:


```yaml
services:
  beszel-agent:
    image: 'henrygd/beszel-agent'
    container_name: 'beszel-agent'
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      # monitor other disks / partitions by mounting a folder in /extra-filesystems
      # - /mnt/disk/.beszel:/extra-filesystems/sda1:ro
    environment:
      PORT: 45876
      KEY: 'ssh-ed25519 YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

**Configuration Steps:**
1. Key Will be provided by server setup for secure communication
2. Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual public key
3. Start the server container
4. Deploy agents on target servers
5. Configure monitoring parameters in the web interface

**Best Practices:**
- Use secure networking between server and agents
- Implement proper backup for Beszel data
- Regular updates of both server and agent containers
- Monitor agent connectivity

#### Prometheus and Grafana Deployment Overview

Prometheus and Grafana can be deployed through several methods, each suited for different environments and requirements. The most straightforward approach is using Docker Compose, which provides a containerized solution ideal for most deployments. Alternatively, you can use Kubernetes with Helm charts for enterprise-scale deployments, or traditional binary installations for bare-metal setups.

For Docker-based deployments, the essential components include Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and various exporters like Node Exporter for system metrics and cAdvisor for container statistics. The setup typically involves creating a Docker Compose file that defines these services and their interconnections. Prometheus is configured through a `prometheus.yml` file, where you specify scrape targets and intervals, while Grafana is configured via environment variables or configuration files.

For production environments, consider these deployment options:
- Docker Compose: Ideal for single-host deployments
- Kubernetes: Best for scalable, distributed environments
- Ansible automation: For consistent multi-host deployments
- Cloud-managed solutions: AWS Managed Grafana or Google Cloud Managed Prometheus

Key configuration considerations include:
- Data persistence through volume mounts
- Security configurations including authentication
- Network access controls
- Backup strategies
- High availability setup for critical environments

For detailed implementation steps, refer to the official documentation: [Prometheus Installation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) and [Grafana Installation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/). Both tools offer extensive customization options and can be tailored to specific monitoring requirements.
