As we progress through this guide, you'll learn how to install tmux on macOS and master its basic commands, setting you on the path to becoming a more efficient terminal user.


## Getting Started with tmux

Before diving into tmux commands, let's first install it on your macOS system. The process is straightforward, especially if you're using a package manager.

### Install tmux on macOS

There are two popular methods to install tmux on macOS: using Homebrew or MacPorts. We'll focus on the Homebrew method as it's widely used and easy to set up.

1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
   If you don't have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run this command:

   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. Install tmux using Homebrew:
   Once Homebrew is installed, you can easily install tmux by running:

   ```sh
   brew install tmux
   ```

   Homebrew will download and install tmux along with any necessary dependencies.

3. Verify the installation:
   After the installation completes, verify that tmux is installed correctly by checking its version:

   ```sh
   tmux -V
   ```

   This command should display the installed version of tmux.

Table: tmux Installation Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install Homebrew | `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` |
| Install tmux | `brew install tmux` |
| Verify installation | `tmux -V` |

That's it! You now have tmux installed on your macOS system. If you encounter any issues during installation, make sure your system is up to date and that you have the necessary permissions to install software.

With tmux now installed, you're ready to start exploring its features and commands. In the next sections, we'll cover how to start your first tmux session and navigate its basic functions.


### Start Your First tmux Session

Now that tmux is installed, let's explore how to start and manage sessions. These basic operations will help you get comfortable with tmux's functionality.

#### Start session

To start a new tmux session:
```sh
tmux
```
This command creates a new session with a default name.

#### Start Session with a session name

To start a new session with a specific name:
```sh
tmux new -s session_name
```
Replace `session_name` with your desired name. This makes it easier to identify and reattach to specific sessions later.

#### Sharing a tmux session

To allow another user to attach to your session (useful for pair programming):
1. Start a session as usual.
2. The other user can attach to your session using:
   ```sh
   tmux attach -t session_name
   ```
   Both users will now be able to view and interact with the same session.

#### Attach Session

To reattach to an existing session:
```sh
tmux attach -t session_name
```
If you don't specify a session name, it will attach to the most recently used session.

#### Detach Session

To detach from a session without closing it:
1. Press the tmux prefix key combination: `Ctrl+b`
2. Then press `d`

This leaves the session running in the background.

#### Exit Session

To completely exit and close a session:
1. Type `exit` in the tmux window, or
2. Press the tmux prefix (`Ctrl+b`) followed by `&`, then confirm with `y`

Table: Basic tmux Session Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Start new session | `tmux` |
| Start named session | `tmux new -s session_name` |
| Attach to session | `tmux attach -t session_name` |
| List sessions | `tmux ls` |
| Detach from session | `Ctrl+b` then `d` |
| Exit session | `exit` or `Ctrl+b` then `&` |

Remember, the prefix key `Ctrl+b` is crucial in tmux. It signals to tmux that the next key pressed is a command, not regular input.

These basic session management commands will get you started with tmux. As you become more comfortable, you'll find that tmux offers much more powerful features for managing your terminal sessions efficiently.

### Tmux Panes

Panes are one of tmux's most powerful features, allowing you to divide a single window into multiple sections, each running its own shell or command.

#### Splitting Panes

  alt="Tmux Splitting Panes"
/>

To split panes, you'll use the tmux prefix (`Ctrl+b`) followed by a specific key:

- Split vertically (left and right):
  ```
  Ctrl+b %
  ```
- Split horizontally (top and bottom):
  ```
  Ctrl+b "
  ```

You can continue splitting existing panes to create complex layouts.

#### Navigating Panes

To move between panes:

- Move to the next pane:
  ```
  Ctrl+b o
  ```
- Move to a specific pane by direction:
  ```
  Ctrl+b <arrow key>
  ```
  Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move in that direction.

#### Closing Panes

To close the current pane:

- Type `exit` in the pane, or
- Use the key combination:
  ```
  Ctrl+b x
  ```
  This will prompt for confirmation before closing the pane.

#### tmux resize pane

Resizing panes can be done using the prefix followed by specific keys:

- Enter resize mode:
  ```
  Ctrl+b :
  ```
  Then type `resize-pane` followed by a direction flag:
  - `-U` (up)
  - `-D` (down)
  - `-L` (left)
  - `-R` (right)

For example, to resize the current pane up by 5 cells:
```
Ctrl+b :
resize-pane -U 5
```

Alternatively, you can use these key combinations for interactive resizing:
```
Ctrl+b Ctrl+<arrow key>
```
Hold down Ctrl and press the arrow keys to resize in that direction.

Table: Tmux Pane Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Split vertically | `Ctrl+b %` |
| Split horizontally | `Ctrl+b "` |
| Navigate to next pane | `Ctrl+b o` |
| Navigate by direction | `Ctrl+b <arrow key>` |
| Close current pane | `Ctrl+b x` or `exit` |
| Resize mode | `Ctrl+b :` then `resize-pane -[U/D/L/R] <number>` |
| Interactive resize | `Ctrl+b Ctrl+<arrow key>` |

Remember, you can always use `Ctrl+b ?` to view a list of all tmux key bindings if you forget any commands.

Working with panes allows you to efficiently manage multiple terminal instances within a single window, greatly enhancing your productivity in the command line environment.

## Changing the Look of tmux

Customizing tmux's appearance can make your terminal experience more enjoyable and productive. Here are some ways to change the look of tmux:

- Change status bar color:
  ```sh
  set -g status-style bg=black,fg=white
  ```

- Change the status bar position (top or bottom):
  ```sh
  set -g status-position top
  ```

- Customize status bar content:
  ```sh
  set -g status-left "[Session: #S] "
  set -g status-right "%H:%M %d-%b-%y"
  ```

### 2. Window and Pane Styling

- Change the active/inactive window colors:
  ```sh
  set -g window-status-current-style bg=yellow,fg=black
  set -g window-status-style bg=green,fg=black
  ```

- Set pane borders:
  ```sh
  set -g pane-border-style fg=green
  set -g pane-active-border-style fg=yellow
  ```

### 3. Enable Mouse Support

For easier navigation and resizing:
```sh
set -g mouse on
```

### 4. Change the Prefix Key

If you find `Ctrl+b` awkward, you can change it. For example, to change it to `Ctrl+a`:
```sh
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix
```
